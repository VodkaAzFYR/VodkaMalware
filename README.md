# VodkaMalware Documentation

## Overview

VodkaMalware is a Python-based tool designed to generate various types of executable files, such as password grabbers, history grabbers, and keyloggers. The tool uses `PyInstaller` to package Python scripts into standalone executables. It also provides functionality to clean up and remove the generated executables.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- `pip` for managing Python packages
- `PyInstaller` for creating standalone executables
- Additional Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`
- Windows operating system (for generating `.exe` files)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd Cracker_Media_Creator
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Running the Main Script

To start the application, run the `main.py` script:
```sh
python main.py
```

### Main Menu

Upon running the script, you will be presented with a main menu with the following options:

- **[P] Generate PasswordsGrabber**
- **[H] Generate HistoryGrabber**
- **[V] Generate VodkaLogger (keylogger)**
- **[I] Install/Update requirements**
- **[E] Exit**

### Generating Executables

#### PasswordsGrabber

1. Select **[P] Generate PasswordsGrabber**.
2. Choose the desired application icon from the list.
3. The tool will generate a PasswordsGrabber executable with the selected icon.

#### HistoryGrabber

1. Select **[H] Generate HistoryGrabber**.
2. Choose the desired application icon from the list.
3. The tool will generate a HistoryGrabber executable with the selected icon.

#### VodkaLogger (Keylogger)

1. Select **[V] Generate VodkaLogger (keylogger)**.
2. Choose the desired application icon from the list.
3. The tool will generate a VodkaLogger executable with the selected icon.
4. An additional `unInfect.bat` script will be generated to remove the keylogger.

### Installing/Updating Requirements

To install or update the required packages, select **[I] Install/Update requirements**. This will pull the latest changes from the repository and install the necessary packages.

### Exiting the Application

To exit the application, select **[E] Exit**.

## Code Structure

### `main.py`

The main entry point of the application. It handles user input and calls the appropriate methods to generate the executables.

### `functions.py`

Contains utility functions and the `Generator` class, which is responsible for creating the executable files.

### `requirements.txt`

Lists the required Python packages for the project.

## Example

Here is an example of how to generate a VodkaLogger executable:

1. Run the main script:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

2. Select **[V] Generate VodkaLogger (keylogger)**.
3. Choose an application icon from the list (e.g., Adobe Reader).
4. The tool will generate the VodkaLogger executable and the `unInfect.bat` script.
